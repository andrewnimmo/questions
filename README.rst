Questions is a Python form library that uses the power of SurveyJS_ for the UI.
The philosophy behind Questions is that modern form rendering usually requires
integrating some complex Javascript widgets anyway, so why not skip the markup
generation completely? 

In Questions, forms are defined in Python similarly to other form frameworks,
but everything on the front end is handled by SurveyJS. This provides a lot of
benefits::

- Nice, integrated UI, with powerful Javascript widgets.
- Full client side validation (plus server side checking, too).
- Complex forms can be defined using simple class composition.
- Easy multi-page forms, with no state-keeping headaches.
- Minimal code for simple apps. If you just need a form or two, you are set.
- And more! Read on.
